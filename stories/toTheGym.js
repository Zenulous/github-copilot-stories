/* I visit the gym with my friends often
One guy is a little bit lazy and he only wants to go to the gym once a week.
The other guy is a little bit lazy and he only wants to go to the gym once a month.
The last guy is a little bit lazy and he only wants to go to the gym once a year.
And I want to know how many times I have to go to the gym in order to get the same amount of exercise as the other guys.
