/* The magician was walking along the dark, gloomy forest
She took a step and saw a big, big tree
It creeked and roared and roared and roared
Its age was about 100 years old
Truly, it was a very old tree
Falsely, it was a very young tree
Maybe it was a tree that was growing
Or maybe it was a tree that was dying
